- memory allocators (arena, etc.)
- array list (dynamic size array)
  - implement higher order functions like sort, map, fold, and filter
- binary tree (maybe other trees too)
- graphs (?)
  - graph algos like dijkstra's
- max/min heap
- hashmap
- set/hashset
- linked list
  - singly and doubly linked
  - implement higher order functions like sort, map, fold, and filter
- logging maybe

note: if writing tests gets to be a bit boring, then write some little
mini-programs that do nothing but demo the functions
